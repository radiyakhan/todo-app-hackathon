## Prompt

/sp.tasks

Context: 003-frontend-ui

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task breakdown for frontend UI implementation with 70 atomic tasks organized by user story.

**Task Organization**:
- **Phase 1: Setup** (9 tasks) - Project initialization, dependencies, configuration
- **Phase 2: Foundational** (12 tasks) - Core infrastructure that blocks all user stories (API client, Better Auth, base components, type definitions)
- **Phase 3: User Story 1** (9 tasks) - Authentication UI (signup, signin, signout)
- **Phase 4: User Story 2** (14 tasks) - Task management interface (CRUD operations, empty state)
- **Phase 5: User Story 3** (13 tasks) - Session persistence, middleware, loading states, error handling, responsive design
- **Phase 6: Polish** (13 tasks) - Cross-cutting concerns, deployment preparation

**Task Format**: All 70 tasks follow strict checklist format:
- `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- 23 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- All user story tasks marked with [US1], [US2], or [US3]
- Every task includes exact file path

**Dependencies**:
- Setup → Foundational (BLOCKING) → User Stories (can run in parallel) → Polish
- User Story 1 (P1): Authentication foundation - no dependencies on other stories
- User Story 2 (P2): Task management - requires US1 for auth but independently testable
- User Story 3 (P3): UX polish - enhances US1 and US2 but independently testable

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Phase 1: 5 tasks can run in parallel (config files)
- Phase 2: 6 tasks can run in parallel (type definitions, UI components)
- Phase 3: 2 tasks in parallel (auth forms), then 2 pages in parallel
- Phase 4: 4 tasks in parallel (task components)
- Phase 5: 4 tasks in parallel (polish tasks)
- Phase 6: 6 tasks in parallel (documentation, config)

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 (30 tasks) deliver authentication UI - minimum viable frontend

**Full Feature**: Phases 1-5 (57 tasks) deliver complete task management with professional UX

**Agent Assignments**:
- Setup & Foundational: `nextjs-ui-architect`
- User Story 1: `auth-security-specialist` + `nextjs-ui-architect`
- User Story 2: `nextjs-ui-architect`
- User Story 3: `auth-security-specialist` + `nextjs-ui-architect`
- Polish: `nextjs-ui-architect`

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Visit signup, create account, sign out, sign back in
- US2: Sign in, create tasks, mark complete, edit, delete
- US3: Sign in, refresh browser, close/reopen tab, trigger errors

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown with 70 atomic, executable tasks organized by user story for independent implementation and testing
- 🧪 Tests: Task planning phase - no tests generated (tests not requested in specification)
- 📁 Files: Created specs/003-frontend-ui/tasks.md (70 tasks across 6 phases)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.implement 003-frontend-ui` to execute implementation with specialized agents, or start with MVP scope (Phases 1-3, 30 tasks)
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown complete with clear dependencies and parallel opportunities. Each user story is independently implementable and testable. MVP scope (US1 only) delivers authentication UI in 30 tasks. Full feature (US1-US3) delivers production-ready task management in 57 tasks. All tasks follow strict checklist format with file paths and agent assignments.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all tasks generated successfully following strict format requirements
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation PASS (70/70 tasks follow checklist format with checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow with context "003-frontend-ui"
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute implementation starting with MVP scope (Phases 1-3) using `/sp.implement`, delegate all tasks to specialized agents (nextjs-ui-architect, auth-security-specialist)
